category: Design Principles
priority: High
principles:
  - title: Clarity First
    description: Every interface should be immediately understandable
    example: Use clear labels, intuitive navigation, and eliminate unnecessary complexity
  - title: Consistency
    description: Similar elements should look and behave the same way
    example: Use consistent button styles, spacing, and interaction patterns throughout the system
  - title: Accessibility
    description: Design for all users, regardless of ability
    example: Ensure proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility
  - title: Progressive Disclosure
    description: Present information in a logical hierarchy
    example: Show essential information first, with details available on demand
  - title: Feedback & Response
    description: Provide clear feedback for all user actions
    example: Loading states, success messages, error handling, and confirmation dialogs

## Our Design Philosophy

These principles form the foundation of our design system. They guide every decision from high-level architecture to micro-interaction details.

### User-Centered Design

Every design decision should be made with the user's needs, goals, and context in mind:

- **Understand the user journey**: Map out how users will interact with features
- **Consider different use cases**: Design for both expert and novice users
- **Test early and often**: Validate assumptions with real user feedback

### Systematic Thinking

Our design system should feel cohesive and intentional:

- **Reuse before creating**: Leverage existing components and patterns
- **Document decisions**: Capture the reasoning behind design choices
- **Scale thoughtfully**: Ensure patterns work across different contexts

### Performance & Efficiency

Good design makes tasks easier and faster:

- **Minimize cognitive load**: Reduce the mental effort required to complete tasks
- **Optimize for common workflows**: Make frequent actions easy to perform
- **Provide shortcuts**: Offer power users ways to work more efficiently

### Emotional Design

Great experiences feel delightful and trustworthy:

- **Build confidence**: Use clear language and predictable interactions
- **Show personality**: Inject appropriate warmth and character
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Turn failures into opportunities to help

### Implementation Guidelines

**For Designers**:

- Use design tokens for all visual properties
- Follow component specifications exactly
- Consider responsive behavior from the start
- Design realistic states (loading, empty, error)

**For Developers**:

- Use design system components whenever possible
- Maintain semantic HTML structure
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles
- Test accessibility with assistive technologies

**For Content**:

- Write in active voice with clear, simple language
- Use consistent terminology throughout the product
- Provide helpful error messages and instructions
- Keep microcopy concise but informative
